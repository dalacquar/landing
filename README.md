# React + TypeScript Landing Page

## Objective

The objective of the project is to make a landing page with an architecture theme, exposing some of the client's projects and presenting them on the website.

## Motivation
This project was made in react with typescript for a simple landing page using the Chakara-ui library because of my affinity with technologies and to facilitate the styling of the landing page.
